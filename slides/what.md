<p>What?</p>
<p>Mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways<br/>
    - Wikipedia</p>

Note:
A mock object is created to test the behavior of some other object
A car designer uses a crash test dummy to simulate the dynamic behavior of a human in vehicle impacts

Mock objects have the same interface as the real objects they mimic
Allow a client object to remain unaware of whether it is using a real object or a mock object.
