What mocking frameworks do:

* Create fake objects
* Set behavior on fake objects
* Verify methods were called

Note:
From now on I will only talk about Mocks. However the separation between the test double types is not very distinct
and they are more of a spectrum than distinct categories. So if at any point you feel like I am not talking about Mocks, 
please consider that I probably still do
